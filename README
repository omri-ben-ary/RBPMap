Steps to create dataset:
1. Use prepare_bed_file on input bed files to fix window size (200 chars) around center, fix dataset size and shuffle data
    1.1 We use 2 bed files to take positive samples from one file and negative from the other. see ./data/README.txt
2. Use meme-suit Bed2Fasta tool in order to generate corresponding fasta file
3. Use prepare_data function on processed bed file and generated fasta file to generate processed dataset
[Optional]
4. Generate RBPMap output file from fasta file in step 2
5. Use label_rbp_map_results function on RBPMap output file
